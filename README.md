# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview

The **Student Performance Analysis** project is designed to analyze educational data, derive insights, and visualize trends in student performance. It provides tools to understand academic outcomes, enabling better decision-making for educators and policymakers.

## Features

- **Data Enrichment**: Map raw data to create additional insights through new columns.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Compute total marks.
  - Identify top-performing students.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Bar plots for overall performance trends.
  - Boxplots for variability analysis.
  - Distribution plots for subject-wise performance.
- **Categorization**: Classify student performance based on numeric grading systems.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
